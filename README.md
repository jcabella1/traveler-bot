# traveler-bot

A Discord bot that I'm developing for personal use. This bot will embark on a wonderful journey...
Working on implementing the following:
- Reminders
- Storing basic character information (for roleplaying purposes)

# Commands
```
!roll - Roll a dice in standard dice notation (e.g. !roll 1d20+5)
!choose - Have the bot choose one item out of a list of items, separated by commas (e.g. !choose coffee, tea, soda)
```
